# 2048
Simple implementation of the 2048 game in C++ where the game only generates `2` (original game randomly generates either a `2` or a `4`) on each move. 

An external file can be provided to the game to load an initial configuration of the board. If an invalid file name has been provided, the default start configuration will be used.
